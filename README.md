--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chocolatey, Ninite and Npackd are way too complicated. I
[needed something simple](http://lorenzo.villani.me/2013/04/08/just-install-my-stuff/) to install
stuff on Windows machines, here it is.

And when I say stupid, I really mean it. It is so dumb it cannot even handle errors! If one
occurs, just-install will happily spit an undecipherable stack trace on the console. The only
thing it is capable of is downloading a setup program and silently execute it. This simplicity
means that it's trivial to add support for new software, seriously,
[check out the registry](https://github.com/lvillani/just-install/blob/master/just-install.json)!


## Installation

Run this command in a command prompt, as Administrator:

```batch
msiexec.exe /i http://go.just-install.it
```

If you like more traditionals means of installation then download
[just-install.msi](http://go.just-install.it), then double click the file to install it yourself.


## Usage

To install a package:

    just-install firefox

To view a list of available packages:

    just-install list

To update the list of available packages:

    just-install update

To forcibly re-download an installer and re-run it:

    just-install -f firefox

To force installation of a package for a specific architecture (use "x86" or "x86_64"):

    just-install -a x86 go
